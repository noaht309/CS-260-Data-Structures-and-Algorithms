# CS-260-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
The project I completed called HashTable exemplifies my knowledge in C++ vectors. That same project also shows my skills in hash table structures. The project called BinarySearchTree best illustrates my knowledge in tree structures.
The HashTable program best illustrates my skills with both search and hash/chaining algorithms. VectorSorting best shows my knowledge of effective sorting algorithms and my awareness of inefficient sorting algorithms.
Tree structures such as a binary search tree can also be useful data structures. Unlike hash tables, tree structures maintain original order. Combining search algorithms with binary trees can be very powerful, allowing for O(log(N)) speeds. We were presented another problem with the original large CSV file of bids—we needed an efficient search algorithm that keeps sorted order and has near-instant searching no matter how many bids there are. My project BinarySearchTree uses a tree structure to maintain list order and solves the problem efficiently. The tree structure is similar to a linked list, however each node holds two pointers. One pointer goes left, and the other goes right. All nodes in its left subtree have a key that’s less than the parent, while all nodes in right subtree are equal or more than the parent. This organization allows for order-keeping and the traversal of a much smaller sublist to get to the target.
